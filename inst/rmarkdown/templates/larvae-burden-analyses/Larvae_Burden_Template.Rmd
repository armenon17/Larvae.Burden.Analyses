##Making sure your R markdown is getting your code from the right place

First let's setup your R markdown so that you can get your data from wherever you have your data stored. If you are importing this code into an newly created project, that should be your root directory. This code will find the root file and make it your directory. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(rprojroot)
rootdir <- toString(find_rstudio_root_file())
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = (rootdir))
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, message = FALSE) 
```



## Why does this template exist 
This template is for cleaning up and graphing data generated from zebrafish larvae infections with M. marinum. Bacterial burden is quantified in zebrafish larvae at 1 and 5 days post infection (1 and 5 dpi) automatically using analysis pipline created by Jared Brewer(burden/burdenMeasurer.py) This will generate typically 2 .csv files (for 1 dpi and for 5 dpi). The csv files are a bit messy so this will clean them up and graph it.


##First load packages
```{r load packages and data}

library(readr)
#readr allows you to import csv and excel files

burden_data_1dpi <- read.csv("Your 1 dpi file here")
burden_data_5dpi <- read.csv ("Your 5 dpi file here")
```


##Simply Labels
The next set of sections are simplifying the labels for each of your images. This based off a certain labelling scheme that I use that goes as follows:
"Date_Fishline_Mmstrain-fluorescent color_#dpi_magnification" 
Example: 2023-03-05_AB_WT-cer_5dpi_5x

```{r create dpi column, include=FALSE}
burdenall <- rbind(burden_1dpi,burden_data_5dpi) 
#make a new data set that combines both imported data sets.

burdenall_clean <- na.omit(burdenall) 
#remove NA rows

names(burdenall_clean)[names(burdenall_clean) == 'X'] <- 'dpi'
#makes a day post infection column
```

Let's simplify days post infection column. Search for _dpi in the your sample label and transfer that number to your dpi column. I have shown 1 and 5 dpi here since that is what we use for standard infections, but this can be altered to different numbers.

```{r simplify dpi column, include=FALSE}
for (i in 1:length(burdenall_clean$Label)) {
  if ((grepl("1dpi", burdenall_clean[i, "Label"]) == TRUE)) {
    burdenall_clean[i,"dpi"] <- 1
  } else if ((grepl("5dpi", burdenall_clean[i, "Label"]) == TRUE)){
    burdenall_clean[i,"dpi"] <- 5
  } else 
    print(FALSE)
}
```



##Are you using different fish lines? Let's make a new column for it and use a similar code as above to find it in yoru Label and transfer it to that column SKIP THIS IF THIS if you are using the same fish line throughout 
```{r create fish line column, include=FALSE}
burdenall_clean["Fish_line"] <- NA
for (i in 1:length(burdenall_clean$Label)) {
  if ((grepl("_fishline1_", burdenall_clean[i, "Label"]) == TRUE)) {
    burdenall_clean[i,"Fish_line"] <- "Fish line 1"
  } else if ((grepl("__fishline2_", burdenall_clean[i, "Label"]) == TRUE)){
    burdenall_clean[i,"Fish_line"] <- "Fish line 2"
  } else if ((grepl("_fishline3", burdenall_clean[i, "Label"]) == TRUE)){
    burdenall_clean[i,"Fish_line"] <- "Fish line 3"     #repeat previous code depending on how many fish lines you have
  } else  
    print(FALSE)
}
```

##Are you using different bacterial strains? Let's make a new column for it and use a similar code as above to find it in yoru Label and transfer it to that column SKIP THIS if you are using the same bacteria strain throughout 
```{r create bacteria strain column}
burdenall_clean["mm_strain"] <- NA

for (i in 1:length(burdenall_clean$Label)) {
  if ((grepl("Bacterialstrain1-fluor", burdenall_clean[i, "Label"]) == TRUE)) {
    burdenall_clean[i,"mm_strain"] <- "Bacteria strain 1"
  } else if ((grepl("Bacterialstrain2-fluor", burdenall_clean[i, "Label"]) == TRUE)){
    burdenall_clean[i,"mm_strain"] <- "Bacteria strain 2"
  } else if ((grepl("Bacterialstrain3-fluor", burdenall_clean[i, "Label"]) == TRUE)){
    burdenall_clean[i,"mm_strain"] <- "Bacteria strain 3"
  } else 
    print(FALSE)
}
```

##If you have any other information you need to gleam from your labelled images, use similar code above to create it here:

##Otherwise, let's remove unecessary columns and create our final data set to graph

```{r create final dataset}
burden_data_final <- burdenall_clean[, -1]
burden_data_final <- burdenall_clean[, -c("Label")]

#now that unecessary columns are removed we can also do our calculations
burden_data_final$FBU = burden_data_final$Area *burden_data_final$Mean

#do a quick check of your dataset to make sure everything is ok
head(burden_data_final)
tail(burden_data_final)

library(usethis)
use_data(burden_data_final, overwrite = TRUE)
write.csv(burden_data_final)
```

## Ok now that I have a clean data set, let's start to analyze and graph it. 

##To make life easier, I will create a new column where each sample is defined by both the MM strain and the DPI. This will make future groupings and statistical analyses easier.


#For each row, I will take the value in the dpi column and the value in the mm strain column and paste it together, separated by an underscore (_)

```{r load summary packages}
#First let's load the relevant packages

library(plyr) #calculates summary data (mean, median, SD, SEM, etc.)
library(tidyverse)
library(reshape2) #to plot mean and standard deviation, we will need to write a function that does this and separates by group
```

```{r group samples}
#Code 1: Unhastag this code if you are only grouping by dpi and mm strain

# burden_data_final$Strain_dpi <- paste(burden_data_final$mm_strain,  burden_data_final$dpi, sep = "_")

#Code 2: Unhastag this code if you are only grouping by dpi, fish line, and mm strain

# burden_data_final$Strain_dpi <- paste(burden_data_final$Fish_line, burden_data_final$mm_strain,  burden_data_final$dpi, sep = "_")
```
##Calculations
Now our data set is cleaned and ready for calculations. Let's calculate the number of samples, mean florescence, and standard deviation Group this by the same groups that you made your Strain_dpi column.

```{r view summary results}
#I will make this into a new data table called cdata

#remove quotes from groups
cdata <- burden_data_final %>%
        group_by("mm_strain", "dpi", "Fish_line(optional)") %>%
        summarize(N = length(FBU),
              Mean_FBU = mean(FBU),
              Median = median(FBU),
              sd   = sd(FBU),
              se   = sd / sqrt(N))


#Lastly, again to make life easier, I will create another Strain_dpi column using the same code for the individual data points.

#Code 1: Unhastag this code if you are only grouping by dpi and mm strain
# cdata$Strain_dpi <- paste(cdata$mm_strain, cdata$dpi, sep = "_")

#Code 2:#Code 2: Unhastag this code if you are  grouping by dpi, fish line, and mm strain
# cdata$Strain_dpi <- paste(cdata$Fish_line, cdata$mm_strain, cdata$dpi, sep = "_")


# I will make a new vector called level order to specify what order I want my data table to show up in
level_order <- c('Strain_1dpi1', 'Strain_1dpi2', 'Strain_1dpi3','Strain_5dpi1', 'Strain_5dpi2', 'Strain_5dpi3')


cdata[match(level_order, cdata$Strain_dpi), ]

```

##Anova Analyses
Now that we can see all of our data, we will analyze it using a 1-way ANOVA
```{r anova, echo=FALSE}
res.aov <- aov(FBU ~ Strain_dpi, data = burden_data_final)

summary(res.aov)

my_comparisons = c("Strain_1dpi1-Strain_1dpi2", "Strain_1dpi3-Strain_1dpi2", "Strain_dpi1-Strain_1dpi3", "WT_5-SigE_5", "SigEcomp_5-SigE_5", "WT_5-SigEcomp_5") 
#the last 3 are examples of labels you can use


MyTukey <- TukeyHSD(res.aov, "Strain_dpi")
MyTukey_DF<- as.data.frame(MyTukey$Strain_dpi)

Results <- subset(MyTukey_DF, rownames(MyTukey_DF) %in% my_comparisons)
#this one is tricky. The order of the comparisons is important, so if you don't see a result for a comparison, try switching the order in "my comparisons"

Final_Results <- Results[match(my_comparisons, rownames(Results)), ]
Final_Results
```

Now we have our summary data and our individual data and we are ready to plot this using ggplot2!

```{r load graphing packages}
library(ggplot2) #read ggplot2 for graphing
library(RColorBrewer) #package with color blind friendly color schemes 
library(ghibli) #another color blind friendly package 
library(extrafont) #import different fonts into your graph 
library(ggsignif) #plot significance data on a graph 
library(ggprism) #make your R graphs look like prism
```

```{r burden plot, echo= FALSE}
# First I will make a new vector called graph order to specify what order I want my x axis variables to be in. (this will normally be the same as your ANOVA order so you can just use level order.) 
graph_order <- level_order

#Now I will make a baseplot to plot the individual data. 
#Data = dataset you are using
#x and y vairables will go in the aesthetics (aes) portion. 
#Our x axis will be our Strain_dpi groupings and the order will be the level order specified above. 

baseplot <- ggplot(data=burden_data_final, aes(x = factor("Strain_dpi" ,levels = graph_order), y="FBU", fill= "mm_strain"))
#unquote X, Y, and fill
#Remember that your X axis needs to as class "factor" for ggplot to properly group your data

#now we will make it pretty and add in significance
#ggsignif only does T-test analyses, so we will input significance levels using results from the 1-way ANOVA

plot_final <- baseplot +
  
  stat_boxplot(fun.y = mean, geom= "errorbar", size=1, width=0.3)+
  
  geom_jitter(aes(colour=mm_strain), size=3, position = position_jitter(width = 0.2))+ #Feel free to adjust these as you want
  
  geom_boxplot(size = 1, alpha =0.3, outlier.shape = NA) +
  #adds mean
  
  guides(fill=FALSE)+ 
  #removes bars
  
  labs(color = "M.marinum strain") + 
  #colors of points will be based on M.marinum strain 
  
  xlab(NULL) + 
  #no additional x axis label will be shown 
 
   scale_y_continuous(name = "Y Label", trans = "log10")+ 
  #add y label 
  
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c(paste0("X Label"))) +
  #add in labels for x axis categories 
  
  ggtitle("Your title here")+ 
  #add in title 
  
  scale_color_manual(values= c("#Value1", "#Value2"))+
  
  scale_fill_manual(values= c("#Value1", "#Value2"))+  #sets colors
  #Standard colors I use: #B50A2AFF, #0E84B4FF
  
  geom_signif(comparisons = list(c("WT_1","SigE_1")),annotation ="Add ANOVA result here", y_position = 7.5)+
  #plot significance levels. Y position is optional, only do this if you don't like the default position
  
  theme_prism()+ 
  #makes it a prism like graph 
  
  theme(legend.position = "none") 
  #remove legend 

plot_final
#look at the plot 
```

##Save and export image
If it Looks fine, now we want to save this in the "Plots and Images folder"
Because setting a working directory only does so in this chunk, I will do that first and then the plot will automatically be saved in that folder.
```{r save plot, include=FALSE}
setwd ("Plots and Images/")
ggsave("Whatever you want to call this.png", plot = plot_final, device = png(), width = 10, height = 6, units = "in")
```

##Yay good job!
